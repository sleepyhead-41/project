            <h1 id="best"> Best places to Visit in Nepal</h1>
            <p class="main">
                Nepal is small in size but it’s big on variety. Best-known for its mountains, the Himalayan nation also
                contains historic towns, wildlife-filled national parks, Hindu and Buddhist pilgrimage sites, tea fields
                and
                much more. Different regions offer different experiences, and are more or less challenging to reach from
                the
                main cities.<br>

                To help you choose, here's a round-up of the top places to visit in <a
                    href="https://www.thecommonwanderer.com/blog/tag/Nepal" target="_blank">Nepal</a>, whether you want
                to
                do some
                gentle sightseeing or have more active plans.
            </p>
            <h1 id="hd"> 1. Kathmandu</h1>
            <p class="main">
                <img src="/images/kathmandu.jpg" alt="kathmandu" id="img">
                Almost all trips to Nepal start in the Kathmandu Valley, and the capital region deserves plenty of time.
                Historically composed of several separate kingdoms — the most prominent being Kathmandu, Patan/Lalitpur,
                and
                Bhaktapur — nowadays, the roughly 25km-wide (15-mile) Kathmandu Valley is one big urban sprawl, with
                ever-diminishing farmland around the edges. The human history of the valley dates back millennia, and
                visitors can still see ancient temples and medieval palaces, and encounter traditional indigenous Newari
                culture, among the haphazard modern concrete constructions.
            </p>
            <h1 id="hd">2.Pokhara</h1>
            <p class="main">
                <img src="/images/pokhara.avif" alt="pokhara" id="img">
                Pokhara, 200km (125 miles) west of the capital and Nepal’s second city, couldn’t be much more different
                from
                Kathmandu. On the shores of Lake Phewa (Phewa Tal) and sitting at the foot of the Annapurna Himalaya,
                the
                mountain views from Pokhara are next level.<br>

                Many people come to Pokhara on the way to and from a trek in the Annapurnas, as there are vehicle
                connections and flight to far-flung mountain towns from here. You can also enjoy paddling a rowboat on
                the
                lake, affordable sundowners on the Lakeside strip, white water rafting on the Seti River, paragliding
                from
                Sarangkot Hill and so on.
            </p>
            <h1 id="hd"> 3. Solukhumbu </h1>
            <img src="/images/solukhumbu.jpg" alt="solukhumbu" id="img">
            <p class="main"> When the weather is really, really clear, and if you know exactly where to look, you may be
                able to get a
                glimpse of a sliver of Mt Everest (Sagarmatha in Nepali, Chomolongma in Sherpa) from Kathmandu.
                Otherwise,
                you’ll need to head to the Solukhumbu District, north-east of the capital, to see the world’s highest
                mountain.

            <h1 id="hd">4. llam</h1>

            <img src="/images/illamm.jpeg" alt="illam" id="img">
            <p class="main">
                Best for tea fields and Mt Kanchenjunga views <br>
                Often overlooked by travelers because it’s a bit out-of-the-way in eastern Nepal, Ilam is the center
                of Nepal’s tea-production industry. Despite bordering tea capital Darjeeling in India, Ilam is less of a
                household name in the tea world, but it shouldn’t be. Travelers can tour the tea fields and admire the
                views
                of
                Mt Kanchenjunga, the third-highest mountain in the world, which sits on the Nepal–India border north of
                Ilam.
            </p>

            <h1 id="hd"> 5. Lumbini</h1>
            <img src="/images/lumbini.jpg" alt="lumbini" id="img">
            <p class="main">
                Best for Buddhist temples and pilgrimage spots,
                Travelers with an interest in Buddhism won’t want to miss Lumbini, in far western Nepal, as it’s
                where the historical Buddha, Prince Siddhartha Gautam, was born. Lumbini is a UNESCO World Heritage Site
                and, as
                well as the modest attractions directly related to Buddha.The town contains temples and monasteries
                built by
                many Buddhist nations and organizations from around the world.
